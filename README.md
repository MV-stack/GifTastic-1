# GifTastic

### Overview

Homework assignment focusing primarily on APIs and AJAX. 

In this assignment, we were asked to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs on a topic of our choice. 

Requrements include: calling on the GIFPHY API and using Javascript/jQuery to change the HTML of the site. 

### Personal Summary

I chose 'Game of Thrones' as my topic - in honor of this long break. The webpage will automatically load a number of already made buttons of your favorite Game of Thrones Characters. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. You can animate the gif my simply clicking on an image. 

Your character is not displayed? You can make your own button with your favorite character by inputing his or her name in the input panel on the right. The button will populate within the array of buttons. 

Bonus! Press on 'The Full Experience' to play the theme song while you explore. Enjoy!
